## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->If we didn’t have birthdays,  
you wouldn’t be you.  
If you’d never been born,  
well then what would you do?  
If you’d never been born,   
well then what would you be?  
You might be a fish!  
Or a toad in a tree!  
You might be a doorknob!   
Or three baked potatoes!  
You might be a bag full of  
hard green tomatoes.  

Or worse than all that…  
Why, you might be a WASN’T!  
A Wasn’t has no fun at all.  
No, he doesn’t.  

A Wasn’t just isn’t. He just   
isn’t present. But you…  
You ARE YOU!  
And, now isn’t that pleasant!
